16. Odd Before Even: You are given two sorted linked lists of length ‘N1’ and ‘N2’ respectively. Your task is to create a linked list with common elements such that all common odd elements are before common even elements. (relative order should be maintained)

17. Stack Implementation Using Array

24. Median in a stream
25. Flip given bits
26. Swap Adjacent Bit Pairs (You are given an integer 'N'. Your task is to find the number formed after swapping each even bit of 'N' in its binary representation with its adjacent bit on the right, assuming that the least significant bit is an odd bit.)

27. Print left view of a binary tree.
28. Implement your own memcpy.
29. Min distance between 2 given nodes in BT
30. Detech loop in CLL
31. Merge overlapping intervals Given 'N' number of intervals, where each interval contains two integers denoting the boundaries of the interval.

32. Search In Rotated Sorted Array 
33. There is a one-dimensional garden of length 'N'. On each of the positions from 0 to 'N', there is a fountain, and this fountain’s water can reach up to a certain range as explained further. In other words, there are 'N' + 1 fountains located at positions 0, 1, 2, 3, …. 'N' which can be activated in the garden.
You are given an integer 'N' and an array/list 'ARR' of length 'N' + 1, where each index of the array denotes the coverage limit of a particular fountain.
A fountain at index 'i' can water the area ranging from the position 'i' - 'ARR'['i'] to 'i' + 'ARR'['i'].
Your task is to find the minimum number of fountains that have to be activated such that the whole garden from position 0 to 'N' has access to the water from at least some fountain.

34. Bellman Ford Algo
35. Swap even and odd bits in given number
36. Remove k-th last node
37. Remove duplicate nodes from the linked list. Follow up -> what if the linked list contains nodes in a sorted manner

38. Modify the array such that every index contains the product of all the elements in the array except itself. Follow up -> what if it contains 0, what if it contains multiple 0s, negative numbers

39. Given a number and an array search the number in the array(not necessarily sorted).(Suggested him a linear scan). Follow up -> what if we receive a lot of queries for that array. (Suggested space vs time trade-off. Either maintain a HashSet or sort the array and binary search).

40. Convert LL to BT
41. Find missing smallest positive number in unsorted array
